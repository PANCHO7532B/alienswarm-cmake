# Project moved
This project backup copy will be moved [here](https://github.com/PANCHO7532/alienswarm-sdk), while this will not be mostly the case for the GitLab one, it will also change the name to "alienswarm-sdk" which you'll access [here](https://gitlab.com/PANCHO7532/alienswarm-sdk)

## Why
I recently recovered my main GitHub account, "PANCHO7532" and I've decided to move the development there instead of keeping it on this secondary account, this is just a matter of convenience for myself so I don't re-log over and over again between accounts

## What
If you cloned this repository and you were working on it this will wipe every commit history and invalidate everything.

The new public repositories will be synced with another repository that I've stored privately on my servers with a few fixes before working on CMake again. If this causes any inconvenience I'm deeply sorry.

## Meanwhile
As soon as everything is lined up, this repository will be deleted forever along with the GitLab one and all development will occur either on my official GitLab account [here](https://gitlab.com/PANCHO7532) or my official GitHub account [also here](https://github.com/PANCHO7532)

## Now
With this, "PANCHO7532B" would be put as a backup account and *also* for interacting with projects still tied to this account.
